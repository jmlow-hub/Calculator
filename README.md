Welcome to my JavaScript Calculator project!

This is my first project with javascript
the key deliverables were to deliver a calculator to a display spec provided using javascript to program the functionality and interact with the DOM.
I decided to base by calcultor around aarrays so that I could push values on button clicks and then display the multiple values in the array on the calculator screen.

I used a separate array and a for loop to target all of the calculator buttons at once. The biggest challenge was how to extract the right data from the array so I had two numbers and the operator to perform the calculation. To do this I wrote three regex to extract the numbers before the operator, the operator itself and the numbers after the operator. 
I added a +/- button that toggles the negative value on or off so that negative numbers can be used and a clear button which clears the current number display back to empty.
