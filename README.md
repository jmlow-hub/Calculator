Welcome to my JavaScript Calculator project
this is my first project with javascript
the key deliverables were to deliver a calculator to a display spec provided (might look familiar.....) using javascript to program the functionality and interact with the DOM
I decided to base by calcultor around an arrays so that I could push values on button clicks and then display the multiple values in the array
I used a separate array and a for loop to target all of the calculator buttons at once and then I used regular expressions to extract the numbers I needed for the calculations
I added a +/- button that toggles the negative value on or off so that negative numbers can be used and a clear button which clears the current number display back to empty
